Compile: make
Run: ./transform < myinput.txt > myoutput.txt
Program Description: The program transforms input of type base 10 or hexadecimal to it's ASCII character value.
The program reads and implements new lines (ex. "10" and "0x0A") as well as recognizes and disregards
comments (ex. "/* this is a comment */"). It also recognizes incorrect input and prints the incorrect input
in the format "<Error: >".

Limitations:
1. I still feel very unknowledgeable in C, so one of the biggest limitations is only being able
to use certain concepts I have learned in the last week. This means my program is probably not as efficient as
it would be if I were to study C for longer.
2. The program only being able reads in 1024 characters on one line.
3. The program only accepts 1 or 2 digit hex numbers of the format "0xzz" or "0Xzz".
